# POSIX profile contract for 0.5.0

`Lokad.Utf8Regex.Posix` is an optional .NET 10/11 adapter with an exact Core
dependency. It owns ERE admission and POSIX selection. Core, PythonRe and PCRE2
retain their contracts. This is an invariant, scalar ERE subset, not complete
locale-sensitive POSIX, GNU or BSD compatibility.

## Input and syntax

Patterns are well-formed Unicode strings; subjects are strict UTF-8. A matching
character is one Unicode scalar, including supplementary characters and U+0000.
Validate the entire subject before matching, including bytes outside a requested
search range. Primary offsets refer to the original bytes; UTF-16 coordinates are
derived. A start offset must be a scalar boundary in `[0,input.Length]` and does
not rebase anchors or remove prefix context.

| Admitted ERE | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Literals, concatenation, `|`, `(expression)` | Case-sensitive scalar matching; parentheses capture in opening order |
| `.`, `[abc]`, `[^abc]`, `[a-z]` | One scalar; ranges use scalar-value order, without locale collation |
| `*`, `+`, `?`, `{m}`, `{m,}`, `{m,n}` | Repetition; interval numbers are 0–255, ordered when both are present |
| `^`, `$` | Absolute subject edges by default; both remain special outside brackets |
| `[[:name:]]` | The twelve fixed ASCII classes listed below |
| Empty expression, branch or `()` | Participating empty match; an explicit supported extension |
| Backslash + ERE punctuation | Literal punctuation outside brackets: `.^$[]()|*+?{}\` |

In brackets, `]` is literal first (after optional `^`), `-` first/last, and
backslash is an ordinary character. Descending ranges, malformed intervals,
adjacent repetition operators and repetition of anchors are errors. Braces
outside valid intervals must be escaped.

The named classes are `alnum`, `alpha`, `blank`, `cntrl`, `digit`, `graph`, `lower`,
`print`, `punct`, `space`, `upper` and `xdigit`, with ASCII C-locale membership.
`space` is HT/LF/VT/FF/CR/space; `blank` is HT/space; `cntrl` includes DEL;
`graph` is U+0021–U+007E and `print` U+0020–U+007E. Negation can match any other
Unicode scalar. There is no culture-dependent classification or case folding.

`PosixCompileOptions.Newline` makes `^`/`$` recognize edges after/before LF as
well as absolute edges, and excludes LF from dot and negated bracket expressions.
Without it, dot and negated brackets can match LF, and `$` means true end (no
special position before a trailing newline). CR has no special treatment.

Reject BRE-specific operator interpretations, collating/equivalence elements, backreferences, lookarounds,
word boundaries, shorthand/property escapes, named/noncapturing groups, inline
flags, lazy/possessive repetition, atomic/balancing/conditional groups and unknown
options. Do not reinterpret these as Core syntax or invoke another matcher.

## Selection and captures

Choose the earliest possible whole-match start, then the greatest end at that
start. Resolve equal whole matches through hierarchical POSIX subpattern priority:
outer nodes before descendants, left parts before right parts. This includes
unparenthesized concatenation/repetition parts, not only returned capture slots.
Associate concatenation to the right for this hierarchy: the first part takes
priority over the remaining suffix. Parentheses preserve their explicit scope.

Within that hierarchy, compare occurrences in iteration order, preferring an
earlier start and then a later end. Participation, including empty, beats absence.
Repeat histories are compared before discarding earlier iterations; if otherwise
equal, a shorter history wins over redundant empty iterations. Descendant
occurrences are compared within their enclosing occurrence. These rules follow
the tagged-history interpretation in [Trofimovich, POSIX section, pp. 10–12](https://re2c.org/2017_trofimovich_tagged_deterministic_finite_automata_with_lookahead.pdf).

Return only the last capture from the winning occurrence history. A group absent
in the final iteration of its enclosing group is absent, even if it participated
earlier. Capture numbering follows opening parentheses, starting at one; zero is
the whole match. Empty captures retain `Success=true` and their actual position;
absent captures use the default unsuccessful value. Do not select by the lengths
of the final returned slots or by the first accepting ordered path.

Historical interpretations identify ambiguity across implementations; see
[WG15 interpretation 135](https://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG15/docs/rr/9945-2/9945-2-135.html).
The rules and fixtures here choose one documented policy. Native implementations
and ordered Core/.NET are not universal capture oracles.

## Initial public surface and lifetimes

Namespace `Lokad.Utf8Regex.Posix`; immutable, reusable `Utf8PosixRegex`:

- Constructors: pattern only; or pattern, `PosixCompileOptions`, timeout and
  `Utf8ResourcePolicy`. Options initially contain `None` and `Newline` only.
  Properties expose `Pattern`, `Options`, `MatchTimeout` and `GroupCount`
  (capturing parentheses, excluding zero).
- `Compile` additionally accepts `Utf8ConstructionPolicy`, a construction timeout
  and original cancellation token. Use existing construction admission/backstops.
- `IsMatch(input, token=default, workingMemoryAllowance=null)` returns existence.
- `Match(input, startOffsetInBytes=0, token=default, workingMemoryAllowance=null)`
  returns `Utf8ValueMatch` for the selected whole match.
- `Match(input, Span<Utf8ValueMatch> groups, startOffsetInBytes=0, token=default,
  workingMemoryAllowance=null)` also writes slots zero onward. Clear supplied
  output slots before publication, including after no match; leave no partial
  result on refusal/interruption. Excess slots are untouched. A shorter or empty span cannot alter
  selection, capture priority or the whole match.
- `Count(input, startOffsetInBytes=0, token=default, workingMemoryAllowance=null)`
  counts nonoverlapping selected matches.
- `CreateMatchCursor(ReadOnlyMemory<byte> input, startOffsetInBytes=0,
  token=default, workingMemoryAllowance=null)` returns a sealed disposable
  `Utf8PosixMatchCursor`. `MoveNext(out Utf8ValueMatch match)` and
  `MoveNext(Span<Utf8ValueMatch> groups, out Utf8ValueMatch match)` use the same
  selection and cumulative invocation. No copied value cursor or finalizer lease.

This surface deliberately uses caller-owned capture spans and value coordinates.
Values survive later calls and cursor disposal without retaining regex storage or
subject bytes. Keep a cursor's borrowed memory unchanged and alive until disposal;
copied references alias one cursor, and disposal rejects further advancement.
Use a cursor from one caller at a time; concurrent advances/disposal are unsupported.
Dispose refunds temporary workspace synchronously. Callers wanting text or owned
arrays materialize them themselves. No replacement/split API, capture-history
collection, RTL option or separate NonBacktracking mode is part of this subset.

After a nonempty match, resume at its end. After an empty match, advance one scalar;
the empty match at subject end is emitted once and completes iteration. For
example, `a*` on `ba` yields empty at 0, `a` at 1 and empty at 2. Count and cursor
agree, including nonzero starts.

## Interruption and admission

Use the [shared resource vocabulary](SPEC.md#cancellation-deadlines-and-resource-limits):
original synchronous cancellation, one absolute deadline from invocation entry,
finite work/depth/working/result policies and caller-owned working admission.
The cursor keeps its original token/deadline and cumulative work/result charges
across advances. No fallback, retry under another budget or partial successful
answer after refusal. Boolean existence can stop on a proved hit; selected matches
and Count must finish the required longest/capture competition.

Bound construction traversal/instructions and admit major arrays before acquiring
them, including growth overlap. Charge matching transitions, candidate discovery,
history comparison/copy and scalar/coordinate scans at bounded interruption
checkpoints. Bound pending alternatives/history workspace and recursion depth;
do not promise worst-case linear matching merely because ERE is regular.
Numerical work/depth/working requirements depend on the execution route and can
change between versions, including when redundant internal histories are omitted.
Recheck finite policies when upgrading; these limits do not measure exact heap size.

Working limits cover modeled matching/history/projection capacity, not borrowed
input, the compiled program, fixed owner metadata, all GC traffic or process RAM.
Caller-owned capture destinations and fixed value coordinates need no producer
result payload; admit any producer-owned result staging before allocation.
These APIs currently create no producer-owned result payload or result staging;
any positive `MaxResultBytes` therefore admits their value/caller-destination output.
Matching histories remain working storage. This limit does not cap arrays/text
that callers create afterward. Timeout exceptions omit subject text.
Shared allowance loans release on completion, refusal, cancellation or disposal.

## Qualification boundary

[Independent selection fixtures](../tests/Lokad.Utf8Regex.Posix.Tests/Corpus/selection.json)
pin ambiguous, nested/repeated/nullable, absent/empty and supplementary-scalar
coordinates before execution changes. Qualification covers every capture-span size,
public discovery/count/cursor routes, malformed subjects/offsets, original-token
and deadline interruption, each finite limit, shared refusal and alias disposal
on both target frameworks. Fixture data alone is not implementation qualification.

The [profile README](../src/Lokad.Utf8Regex.Posix/README.md#benchmarks) records warm
public-operation and finite-policy costs. Four-package delivery also checks both
target frameworks, Windows/Linux and isolated package consumers; the
[0.5.0-dev.56 receipt](../bench/Experiments/DeliveryDev56-20261108/README.md)
records the accepted boundary. Subsequent changes need a fresh candidate at the
next delivery boundary. No complete POSIX equivalence or general native throughput
parity is claimed.
