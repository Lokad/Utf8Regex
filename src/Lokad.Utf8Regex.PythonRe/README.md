# Lokad.Utf8Regex.PythonRe

Development source: **0.4.0-rc.3-dev**; no new package candidate is staged. Frozen **0.4.0-rc.2** has Windows/Linux correctness and consumer evidence, while its cumulative performance gate is **inconclusive**. See the [current release correction](https://github.com/Lokad/Utf8Regex/blob/master/bench/Experiments/ReleaseCandidate2-20261026/ERRATA.md). RC1 is superseded.

**0.4.0-rc.3-dev**, .NET 10. A managed Python `re`-style adapter over strict UTF-8
Unicode scalars, requiring exactly `Lokad.Utf8Regex [0.4.0-rc.3-dev]`. It can coexist
with the PCRE2 adapter at the same version. No Python runtime or BCL regex matcher
is a shipped implementation dependency.

## Supported scope

The profile targets the documented CPython 3.13.2 `str` grammar with owned Unicode
15.1.0 identifier/class/case data. Patterns are parsed before scalar lowering.
Captures are numbered in opening order; references/conditionals, fixed-width
lookbehind, greedy/lazy repetition, scoped flags and Python empty-match retry use
the owned engine. `LastIndex`/`LastGroup` identify the last capture to close on the
successful path; an unnamed last capture has a null name. Unmatched captures keep
the documented null/empty shaping for each API.

Search, Match and FullMatch expose value, detailed, string and UTF-8 forms.
`FindIterDetailed` returns owned capture snapshots. `FindAllToStrings` and
`FindAllToUtf8` provide Python-shaped scalar/tuple outputs; `FindAll` is the
structural full-match collector. Split and template/callback replacement include
capture-aware output shaping and substitution counts. Primary ranges are byte
coordinates; derived UTF-16 coordinates do not define matching width.

Bytes-pattern semantics, LOCALE and `\N{...}` Unicode-name lookup are excluded.
There is no `endpos` parameter. Start offsets follow the documented Python `pos`
contract without resetting prefix/suffix assertion context. This is a selected
profile, not complete Python `re` equivalence. See the
[profile specification](https://github.com/Lokad/Utf8Regex/blob/master/docs/SPEC-PYTHONRE.md).

## Controls and lifetimes

Instances accept positive nullable `Utf8ResourcePolicy.MaxWorkSteps`, `MaxDepth`,
`MaxWorkingBytes` and `MaxResultBytes`. Null is unlimited; zero is invalid.
**Defaults remain unlimited.** Work includes covered validation, matching and
required shaping cumulatively. Depth admits live frames before acquisition;
working/result controls admit modeled major capacities and growth overlap.
Result/staging charges do not refund and may conservatively count storage again.
Denials use `Utf8ResourceLimitExceededException` with the corresponding
`Execution*` resource kind. This is not a total heap/RSS or caller-retention bound.

Replacement evaluator delegates must be non-null, even on misses; otherwise
`ArgumentNullException` names `evaluator`. An already-cancelled explicit token
still takes precedence. Return-value rules for valid callbacks are unchanged.

Strict full-subject validation, original synchronous cancellation and one absolute
deadline apply through required shaping and persistent cursor advances, including
waits between moves. Caller callbacks cannot be preempted; copying/encoding their
returned output remains covered. Timeouts use `RegexMatchTimeoutException`; its
Input is empty when working or result bytes are bounded to avoid decoding the
subject for diagnostics after expiry.

Explicit `Compile` factories accept separate construction limits, timeout and
token, and eagerly prepare FullMatch. Constructors keep fixed construction
backstops and lazy FullMatch preparation. Cold FullMatch/replacement preparation,
cache retention, incidental owners, standalone getters, callback allocations and
host containers retain separate documented scope. The execution token must be
passed on each operation. See [HOST-INTEGRATION.md](https://github.com/Lokad/Utf8Regex/blob/master/docs/HOST-INTEGRATION.md)
and [MIGRATION.md](https://github.com/Lokad/Utf8Regex/blob/master/docs/MIGRATION.md).

Named captures remain distinct when Unicode identifiers and names such as `g1`
are mixed. Public names and Python opening-order numbering remain unchanged.
Fixed finite policies omit optional unmetered Core runtime/emission storage and
native prefix buffers those instances cannot execute. Useful search/scalar
preparation remains; lower construction charges can admit earlier-denied patterns.

Optional Core preparations support native iteration, canonical literal FindAll
string counting, literal values/results and scalar cursor start hints. The current
grammar-level iteration flag can also retain Core for patterns whose operations
decline it. Tightening that flag is deferred after a bounded cost experiment;
backend presence alone does not establish execution. A Core preparation may still
be built transiently to discover eligibility, under the original construction
owner. Discarding a root reduces retention, not all construction traffic.

Default and unsuccessful detailed results expose empty capture/name arrays and
empty value text. Default match/group data also expose empty text. Successful
snapshots keep their supplied arrays and retain their values across later calls.

## Public API

```csharp
using System;
using Lokad.Utf8Regex;
using Lokad.Utf8Regex.PythonRe;

var regex = new Utf8PythonRegex(
    pattern: @"(?P<word>foo)-(?P=word)",
    options: PythonReCompileOptions.None,
    matchTimeout: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1),
    resourcePolicy: new Utf8ResourcePolicy
    {
        MaxWorkSteps = 1_000_000,
        MaxDepth = 1024,
        MaxWorkingBytes = 16 * 1024 * 1024,
        MaxResultBytes = 16 * 1024 * 1024
    });

bool isMatch = regex.IsMatch("foo-foo"u8);
var first = regex.Search("xx foo-foo yy"u8);
int count = regex.Count("foo-foo x foo-foo"u8);
byte[] replaced = regex.Replace("foo x foo"u8, "<\\g<word>>");
Utf8PythonMatchData[] matches = regex.FindAll("foo-foo xx foo-foo"u8);
var iter = regex.FindIterDetailed("foo-foo xx foo-foo"u8);
string?[] parts = regex.SplitToStrings("foo-foo xx foo-foo"u8);
```

String-returning helpers such as `SearchToString(...)`, `ReplaceToString(...)`, and `FindAllToStrings(...)`
are also available as host-friendly conveniences when a runtime needs scalar string results.

`CreateMatchCursor(ReadOnlyMemory<byte>)` discovers one detailed snapshot per
`MoveNext` instead of materializing the complete `FindIterDetailed` array:

```csharp
ReadOnlyMemory<byte> subject = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("é😀");
using var cursor = new Utf8PythonRegex("(?P<scalar>.)").CreateMatchCursor(subject);
while (cursor.MoveNext())
{
    Utf8PythonDetailedMatchData match = cursor.Current;
    // The supplementary scalar occupies four bytes and is one match.
    Console.WriteLine(match.Value.ValueText);
}
```

Keep the subject unchanged and its memory manager alive until exhaustion or
disposal. Dispose when stopping early. The cursor has one shared position and
lifetime across reference aliases, rejects concurrent/reentrant access, and has
no finalizer. EOF and failure release scratch and subject references immediately.
Returned snapshots own their arrays and text and remain valid after advance or
disposal. Sequential advances may cross host calls or asynchronous waits; those
waits count against the original absolute match deadline. The offset/token
overloads preserve scalar-aligned byte offsets and the original invocation token.
Existing span APIs retain their existing contracts.


A cursor has cumulative work/result allowance across all moves. Scratch remains
charged while positioned and releases at EOF/failure/Dispose. Published snapshots
never borrow reusable scratch. Faults preserve earlier snapshots; a new call gets
a new allowance and needs new host admission while earlier results survive.
Core value-cursor copies have independent positions/shared allowance; PythonRe
reference aliases share position/disposal. No finalizer-based lease is required.
